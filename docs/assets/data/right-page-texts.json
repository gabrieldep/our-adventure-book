    "Wise men say\nOnly fools rush in\nBut I can't help\nFalling in love with you\n\nShall I stay?\nWould it be a sin\nIf I can't help\nFalling in love with you?\n\nLike a river flows\nSurely to the sea\nDarling, so it goes\nSome things are meant to be\n\nTake my hand\nTake my whole life too\nFor I can't help\nFalling in love with you",
    "\"Home is not where you were born; home is where all your attempts to escape cease.\"\n— Naguib Mahfouz",
    "\"So, okay? Here tonight, we have apple and orange. We all different, but in the end, we all fruit\"",
    "When the night has come\nAnd the land is dark\nAnd the Moon is the only light we'll see\nNo, I won't be afraid\nOh, I won't be afraid\nJust as long as you stand, stand by me",
    "You're just too good to be true\nCan't take my eyes off of you\nYou'd be like Heaven to touch\nI wanna hold you so much\nAt long last, love has arrived\nAnd I thank God I'm alive\nYou're just too good to be true\nCan't take my eyes off of you",
    "[...]Release your inhibitions\nFeel the rain on your skin\nNo one else can feel it for you\nOnly you can let it in\nNo one else, no one else\nCan speak the words on your lips\nDrench yourself in words unspoken\nLive your life with arms wide open\nToday is where your book begins",
