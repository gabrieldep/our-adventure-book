    "Wise men say\nOnly fools rush in\nBut I can't help\nFalling in love with you\n\nShall I stay?\nWould it be a sin\nIf I can't help\nFalling in love with you?\n\nLike a river flows\nSurely to the sea\nDarling, so it goes\nSome things are meant to be\n\nTake my hand\nTake my whole life too\nFor I can't help\nFalling in love with you",
    "\"Home is not where you were born; home is where all your attempts to escape cease.\"\n— Naguib Mahfouz",
    "\"So, okay? Here tonight, we have apple and orange. We all different, but in the end, we all fruit\"",
    "When the night has come\nAnd the land is dark\nAnd the Moon is the only light we'll see\nNo, I won't be afraid\nOh, I won't be afraid\nJust as long as you stand, stand by me"
